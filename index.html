            <p>
                I'm Howard Portney, a dedicated web developer with over 20 years of experience in both corporate and freelance environments. I have a solid background in <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>, excelling at developing dynamic, responsive, and accessible websites. My experience includes extensive <strong>cross-platform</strong> and <strong>cross-browser</strong> development, ensuring that all applications function seamlessly across various devices and environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am continuously improving my skills in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>, and I'm currently starting to learn <strong>Drupal</strong> for effective content management. Additionally, my proficiency in <strong>Photoshop</strong> allows me to create visually appealing designs that enhance user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Committed to <strong>user-centered design</strong>, I apply <strong>UX design principles</strong> to ensure that the web solutions I deliver not only meet functional requirements but also provide an intuitive and engaging user experience. My passion lies in collaborating with clients to understand their unique needs and translating them into effective web solutions that drive results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working in collaborative environments and am always eager to take on new challenges that contribute to my professional growth in web development.
